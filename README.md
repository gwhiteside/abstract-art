This Android live wallpaper recreates the hypnotic tripped-out visuals featured in the cult classic SNES game Earthbound (Mother 2). Even if you've never heard of it, these animated wallpapers stand on their own. With the hundreds of rockin' backgrounds available in this tiny package, you practically can't afford not to download it! Grab it now to give your device sweet visuals with low power consumption, and be the first person on your street with a totally boss wallpaper that doesn't bust the battery.

Flaunt your style while remaining environmentally conscious... Makes a great conversation starter... Use it to help meet the person of your dreams... The possibilities are virtually endless!

Instructions
------------

1.  Install and set as your live wallpaper.

2.  Double tap a blank spot on your home screen to load a different random background (behavior is configurable in the settings).

3.  Check out the background chooser (accessible via the settings) to make a custom background playlist!

Background Chooser
------------------

*  Click on a thumbnail once to preview it. Click it two or more times to check/uncheck it.

*  Every background that you check will be included in a custom wallpaper "playlist."

*  If you only want a single background to display, clear all the checks, and recheck the one you like.

*  The "Select All" and "Clear All" methods are included (press your menu button or check the action bar) for your convenience. :)
